### Hand picked top projects for Lisk


# Our mission üöÄ

Our mission is to create a directory of useful resources for Lisk and promote good delegates that are actively contributing to the growth of Lisk.


# Submit a new hunt

Did you find a new Lisk resource? Did you develop something cool? 

Everything that is a resource for the Lisk ecosystem can be submitted. So let's say an (d)App, a pool, guide or community can be submitted to LiskHunt.

In order to submit a new hunt, you will have to fill this form:
 

#  Submit a cool delegate
Are you a delegate? Join liskhunt, we are looking forward to hear from you!
In order to do that, please fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/4iwUizm6PrcmMdIG2)


# How does the coolness score work?

The **Coolness score** is our super-duper recipe to indicate how is the delegate contributing to Lisk.
The score takes into consideration multiple factors, such as:
- Resources developed
- Resources
- Likes & upvotes in the platform
- Donations
- Commits to LiskHQ
- Moderators of the lisk.chat
- Share rewards
- Ambassadors
- Marketing events
- Public nodes
- Snapshot server
- Long time investors and big wallets.
And more factors that will come out by the community...

Which is a sum of:

 * Every application has a score of `100 points`
 * Every donated Lisk is `* 0.01`
 * Ambassador for Lisk `+ 70`
 * Moderator of the Lisk.chat `+ 70`
 * Having a public node `+ 10`
 * Hosting a Snapshot server `+ 40`
 * Github commits `+ 1 per commit`
 * Upvotes `+ 1 per upvote`
 * Marketing `50 per event`
 * Share rewards `* 2`
 
#### Todo:
Add in the score:


[ ] Long time investors and big wallets.
