### Hand picked top projects for Lisk


# Our mission üöÄ

Our mission is to create a directory of useful resources for Lisk and promote good delegates that are actively contributing to the growth of Lisk.


# Submit a new hunt or a cool delegate

Did you find a new Lisk resource? Did you develop something cool? Are you a delegate?

Everything that is a resource for the Lisk ecosystem can be submitted. So let's say an (d)App, a pool, guide or community can be submitted to LiskHunt.

In order to submit a new hunt, you can create a new Pull-Request to this repository on Github. 
You'll just need to add the new resource to `src/lib/resources/resources.js`, commit and submit the PR.


If you want to submit a new delegate that is not on the list or a good action of a delegate (such as a donation). You can submit it by opening an issue on this repo.
 
 
You don't want to submit via Github? No problem, get in touch with carbonara on the lisk.chat or by email `carbonara [at] lisk.rocks`.

# How does the coolness score work?

The **Coolness score** is there to indicate how is the delegate contributing to Lisk.
The score takes into consideration multiple factors, such as: resources developed, likes in the applications, donations (to any cause related to Lisk).

Which:

 * Every application has a score of 10 points.
 * Every like is 1 point.

Donations are divided into 3 tiers with different scoring.

 * Donations from 0 to 100 Lisk are scored as 1 point.
 * Donations from 100 to 500 Lisk are scored as 5 points.
 * Donations from 500+ Lisk are scored as 7 points.

In the calculation of this score, in the near future we will include: ambassadors, mods of the Lisk chat, commits to the official repos, efforts to promote Lisk and whatever cool ideas will come from the community.
